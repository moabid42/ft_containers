4. specific type of balanced binary search trees

**Rules:**
* a node is either red or black
* root and leaves (NIL) are black
* if a node is red, its children are black
* all paths from a node to its NIL descendants contain the same number of black nodes

- longest path is no more than twice the length of the shortest path
    - shortest: all black nodes
    - longest: alternating red and black

**Operations:**
- all operations have a time complexity of O(log n)
* Search
* Insert, require rotation
* Remove, require rotation
